## We Worship You
### John Schlitt




Thank you, my Lord, for loving us

We know it's not deserved

Guiding us through our daily walk

You teach us with Your Word

Even with our failings

You are so forgiving

This is why we give our thanks to You

We lift up our hands, we lift up Your Name

We lift up our voices, "You are Lord" we proclaim

We give You our hearts, we give You our praise

We give You the glory, forever You'll reign

We worship You, oh Lord, we worship You

Father, we know that by ourselves

Our lives would be a loss

But through Your Son our lives were won

With His death upon the Cross

We don't understand it

Why He chose to face it

But we know He made the sacrifice

We lift up our hands, we lift up Your Name

We lift up our voices, "You are Lord" we proclaim

We give You our hearts, we give You our praise

We give You the glory, forever You'll reign

We worship You, oh Lord, we worship You

We lift up our hands, we lift up Your Name

We lift up our voices, "You are Lord" we proclaim

We give You our hearts, we give You our praise

We give You the glory, forever You'll reign

We worship You, oh Lord.

We worship You oh Lord, we worship You...
